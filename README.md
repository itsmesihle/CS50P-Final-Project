# Rock Paper Scissors Game

A clean, modular, and fully logged Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in **Python**, featuring:

- User vs Computer CLI gameplay
- Score tracking
- CSV game-logging with timestamps
- Terminal ASCII-art welcome screen
- Input validation & robust structure

This project demonstrates beginner–intermediate Python fundamentals and is suitable for CS50P learners or anyone practicing Python structure and file handling -> THIS NEEDS TO BE WORKED ON ASAP!!

## 📌 **Project Description**

This is a console-based Rock–Paper–Scissors game where the welcomes the user with ASCII-art:

- _insert example_

The user is then prompted to select the number of rounds they would like to play:

- _insert example_

At this point the user is asked to select either rock, paper or scissors:

- **(r)** rock
- **(p)** paper
- **(s)** scissors

The computer randomly selects one of the three options, after which:

- The winner is determined
- The round is logged with timestamp, scores and results into `RPS_game_data.csv`

After the set number of rounds, a final scoreboard summary is displayed. After which the `RPS_game_date.csv` is saved, closed and stored on the local computer.

## 🧠 **Skills Showcased**

### **Python Fundamentals**

- Functions & modular programming
- Conditionals & loops
- Error handling with `try`/`except`
- User input validation
- Working with external libraries
- Use of the `__name__ == "__main__"` guard

### **Intermediate Concepts**

- File handling (CSV reading/writing)
- Logging data with timestamps
- Using 3rd‑party modules (`pyfiglet`)
- Clean code structuring
- Separation of concerns in functions

### **Soft Skills Demonstrated**

- Documentation
- Code readability & maintainability
- Defensive programming

## 📦 **Libraries & Modules Used**

### **Standard Library**

- `random` – computer choice
- `csv` – game data logging
- `datetime` – timestamp generation
- `os` – file checking
- `json` – used in development/testing

### **Third-Party Libraries**

- **pyfiglet** → ASCII‑art title screen
- **pytest** → unit-testing

Manual install with:
`bash\pip install pyfiglet pytest`

### `project.py`

Contains all game logic:

- User prompts
- Computer randomization
- Winner determination
- CSV logging
- Scoreboard output

### `requirements.txt`

Contains all the requirements, dependencies necessary to run the game and the tests:

- Python (>3.8)
- Pyfiglet
- Pytest

### `RPS_game_data.csv`

Stores:

- Timestamp
- User choice
- Computer choice
- Round result

### **`test_project.py`**

- uses Pytest to test the working order of the functions project.py by importing its modules
- _add more descriptive_

### **`README.md`**

- Contains documentation of the project.
